# IG-Marketing
## Overview
Welcome! This project simulates the experience of a marketing analyst who is working on defining Instagram's marketing strategy. By manipulating 7 tables within this dataset, we are able to answer questions regarding user behavior and preferences. This information can be used make key strategic decisions such as deciding to target a specific audience with a new campaign or launching an initiative to remove bots from our platform.
